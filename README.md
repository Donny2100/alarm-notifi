# Alarm-notifi
Since there appeard to be many confusions about alarm manager and notification manager here is a simple android application which uses
the alarm manager to display a notification at a user set time (here seconds). I have added a vibration when the notification pops up instead of an alarm to make the code simpler. You can use a ringtone by using a [ringtone manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager.html) ringtone picker is also available.
